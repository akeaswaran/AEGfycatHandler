{"name":"AEGfycatHandler","tagline":"A simple Objective-C wrapper for the Gfycat API. ","body":"AEGfycatHandler\r\n===============\r\nAn simple Objective-C wrapper for the [Gfycat API](http://gfycat.com/api).\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\nJust drag and drop the AEGfycatHandler folder into your Xcode project and import `AEGfycatViewerController.h` or `AEGfycatHandler.h` where needed. Alternatively, you can add `pod 'AEGfycatHandler'` to your Podfile and have Cocoapods import the files for you.\r\n\r\n###Usage\r\nIt is recommended to use `AEGfycatViewerController` or a custom subclass of it to handle all of your Gfycat needs, but if you want to use another custom view controller to handle Gfycat viewing, you can import `AEGfycatHandler.h` and call the methods you need. \r\n\r\nBoth `AEGfycatViewerController` and `AEGfycatHandler` have well-commented header files that explain how to use each method and what each method returns, as well as in-line comments where necessary to explain certain decisions.\r\n\r\n###License\r\nSee [License.md](https://github.com/akeaswaran/AEGfycatHandler/blob/master/License.md).\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
